Welcome to TREvoSim's User Manual
=================================

The [Tr]ee [Evo]lutionary [Sim]ulator program.

TREvoSim is an individual-based evolutionary model, focussing on the simulation of evolutionary trees and associated character data through a simplified first-principles approach. It shares a number of elements in common with the model REvoSim (see Garwood et al. 2019, relevant references), but differs in species concept, and eschews both space and sexual reproduction.

TREvoSim has been released with the intention that it can be used as a multipurpose platform for the study of many evolutionary phenomena, but in particular, acts as one of the few methods for simulating character data and tree topology at the same time, and one of a highly limited number of individual-based simulations capable of doing so. We note that, as with REvoSim, this package is complementary to the many other approaches of studying evolution on a range of different timescales, and will be continually developed by the core team to expand its capabilities.
